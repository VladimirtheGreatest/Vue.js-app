# Vue.js-app
Vue is a newer and refreshing framework for building web apps with at least an order of magnitude more ease than writing vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Vue frees our data from the DOM, and provides an idiomatic guide to programming JavaScript, making development much faster and more fun.
I will be experimenting and building various simple apps with VUE.
